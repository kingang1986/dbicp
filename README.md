Abstract
The DBICP Project studies a point based registration algorithm called the “Dual Bootstrap Iterative Closest Point”.

This algorithm extends the classic Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm, to overcome issues such as initialization sensitivity, few overlap, and unreliable matches. The innovations are made in the algorithm's structure, where the region used – the bootstrap region –, and the parametric transformation model selected are progressively “bootstrapped”, meaning enlarged.

Finally, my source code is available on this website
